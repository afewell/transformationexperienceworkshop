## Flow

1. Ops reviews install process and architecture?
2. Ops does account setup/onboarding for dev
3. Ops creates an accelerator
    - This could be like copy existing accelerator, make some minor tweek as example of corporate requirement/norm, create new accelerator 
4. Devs join, Ops onboards devs
5. Devs use an accelerator ideally with gitops integration
6. Devs iterate on code, ideally using live view and developer tools 
7. Devs deploy to "prod"
8. Review the supply chain stuff, make any approvals needed
9. ?should we? review application lifecycle management and make update to prod app
10. retro
